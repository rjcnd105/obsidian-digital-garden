I decided to spend a few hours researching the seemingly endless benefits of Agmatine Sulfate. Recently [examine.com](https://examine.com/) updated their dosage with a new study showing 2-3g/ day of Agmatine being effective in treating depression in 3 people. After complaining everywhere that the 500mg/day dose was too small to be effective, I'm proud to see my initial opinion be validated by science. I've been using for 6 months and it has cured my depression.
